## Technologies

It is built with `CreateReactApp`, `ReduxToolkit`, `ReactRouter` and `StyledComponents`. It uses `amiiboapi` to fetch products data.

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to serve a develop environment on port `3000`
- or you can run `npm run build` to build the app for prodduction and then run `serve -s build` to serve the build to port `3000`

## Approach

I used the `Redux Toolkit` official package to implement `Redux` logic in a standard and minimized way.

## Status

Amiibo e-commerce is finished. It will only receive some minor added features.

## Author

The project is from my authority.
